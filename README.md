This is a retweet bot for Twitter. It will take the params from the config file
and retweet tweets containing the keywords given in BotConfig::BOT_KEYWORDS.

## Installation

Clone the repository somewhere on your server. If you want to view the log in
your browser, you will need to have the index.php somehow parsed by your
webserver, e.g. by putting the repository in the document root or  creating an
alias that links to the index.php

**Important:** Don't forget to initiate the git modules.
